<h1 align="center">InAppUpdater</h1>
<p align="center">Android Library to easily implement <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/in-app-updates">in-app updates</a></p>

## :pencil2: Usage

### Step 1: Add it in your root build.gradle
```Gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```
### Step 2: Add the dependency
```Gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.SanojPunchihewa:InAppUpdater:1.0.2'
}
```

### Step 3: Initialize the UpdateManager
Initialize the UpdateManager in your `onCreate` method of the Activity
```java
    UpdateManager.Builder().mode(UpdateManagerConstant.IMMEDIATE).start(this);
```

#### Update Mode
There are two modes
* Flexible *(default)* - User can use the app during update download, installation and restart needs to be triggered by user

* Immediate - User will be blocked until download and installation is finished, restart is triggered automatically


#### Set the update mode
```java
     UpdateManager.Builder().mode(UpdateManagerConstant.IMMEDIATE)
```

### Step 4: Resume the updates
Call `continueUpdate` method in your `onResume` method to install waiting updates
```java
@Override
protected void onResume() {
    super.onResume();
    UpdateManager.continueUpdate(this);
}
```
## :exclamation: Troubleshoot
- In-app updates works only with devices running **Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher**
- In-app updates are available only to user accounts that own the app. So, **make sure the account youâ€™re using has downloaded your app from Google Play at least once before using the account to test in-app updates.**
- Make sure that the app that you are testing in-app updates with has the **same application ID and is signed with the same signing key** as the one available from Google Play.
- Because Google Play can only update an app to a higher version code, make sure the app you are **testing as a lower version code than the update version code.**
